# Razor: An Ultima Online Assistant

## UO:R Community Edition

The purpose of this fork of Razor is continue development on Razor that focuses on "quality of life" improvements to Razor while keeping the spirit of Razor intact.

This version is tagged the **UO:R Community Edition** simply due to the fact that most of the feedback, ideas and testing as come from the **[UO Renaissance](http://www.uorenaissance.com/)** community.  I am not associated with the staff or administration of this shard, I am simply a player and a fan of the UO era this shard represents.

This version of Razor is based off of 1.0.13.13 (well technically 1.4.0.3, but the differences between them are based on the .NET version they were upgraded to).

**TL;DR:** If you use Razor today, regardless of the Ultima Online server you play on, this version should also work.

## History

Razor was originally developed by **Zippy** and eventually made public on [GitHub](https://github.com/msturgill/razor) years later.  Originally the Crypt.dll and Loader.dll code was withheld to prevent people from building their own versions of Razor but they were made available sometime in the past.

The original project was last updated May 2nd, 2014 and while over 50 forks exist, none have been active or have made significant changes except for a few exceptions.

* @jaedan (which this fork is based on) who updated the project to compile and work in Visual Studio 2017 and made improvements to Crypt.dll
* @uoitalia who made several performance changes from generic to non-generic collections.

A closed source project of Razor, version 1.0.14.*, made some great improvements to Razor and this version has incorporated many of those.
