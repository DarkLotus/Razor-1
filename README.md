# Razor

This is a fork of the Ultima Online Razor assistant from https://github.com/msturgill/razor which is forked from the original project by Mark Sturgill . The goal of this fork is to support the Ultima Online 5.0.8.3 client on UO Renaissance while making small "quality of life" improvements to Razor while keeping the spirit of Razor intact.
